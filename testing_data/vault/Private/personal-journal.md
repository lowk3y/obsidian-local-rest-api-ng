# Personal Journal

This is a private journal entry. It should be **DENIED** by the folder rule `deny folder Private/**`.

## Entry: 2026-02-17

Today I worked on testing the security filter. The filter should prevent any API access to files in this folder.

If you can read this through the API, the folder filter is NOT working correctly.
